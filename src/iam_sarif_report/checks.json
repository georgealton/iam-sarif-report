In this\ncase, the condition in the `Deny` statement always returns `false` and the\naction is never denied. This happens even if the resource is tagged correctly.\n\nWhen a service supports the `aws:ResourceTag` condition key, you can use tags\nto control access to that service\u00e2\u0080\u0099s resources.

IAM Access Analyzer returns findings\nfor the service actions that are not supported. For example, Amazon S3\nsupports `aws:ResourceTag` for a subset of its resources.

Also\nassume that AWS Lambda allows you to tag and untag resources, but doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nsupport the `aws:ResourceTag` condition key. To deny the delete actions for\nAWS App Mesh and AWS Backup if this tag is present, use the `aws:ResourceTag`\ncondition key. For Lambda, use a resource naming convention that includes the\n`\"Confidential\"` prefix. Then include a separate statement that prevents\ndeleting resources with that naming convention.\n\n    \n    \n    {\n        \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\",\n        \"Statement\": [\n            {\n                \"Sid\": \"DenyDeleteSupported\",\n                \"Effect\": \"Deny\",\n                \"Action\": [\n                    \"appmesh:DeleteMesh\", \n                    \"backup:DeleteBackupPlan\"\n                    ],\n                \"Resource\": \"*\",\n                \"Condition\": {\n                    \"StringEquals\": {\n                        \"aws:ResourceTag/status\": \"Confidential\"\n                    }\n                }\n            },\n            {\n                \"Sid\": \"DenyDeleteUnsupported\",\n                \"Effect\": \"Deny\",\n                \"Action\": \"lambda:DeleteFunction\",\n                \"Resource\": \"arn:aws:lambda:*:403299380220:function:Confidential*\"\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n\nWarning\n\nDo not use the\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a6[IfExists](./reference_policies_elements_condition_operators.html#Conditions_IfExists)\nversion of the condition operator as a workaround for this finding.

To deny the delete actions for AWS App\nMesh and AWS Backup if this tag is present, use the `aws:ResourceTag`\ncondition key.

AWS\nrecommends that you explicitly list the actions that you want to allow. IAM\nAccess Analyzer returns a separate finding for listed actions that don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nsupport the `aws:ResourceTag` condition key. For more information, see\nSuggestion \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Allow with unsupported tag condition key for service.\n\nWhen a service supports the `aws:ResourceTag` condition key, you can use tags\nto control access to that service\u00e2\u0080\u0099s resources. This is known as [attribute-\nbased access control (ABAC)](./introduction_attribute-based-access-\ncontrol.html). Services that don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t support these keys require you to control\naccess to resources using [resource-based access control\n(RBAC)](./introduction_attribute-based-access-\ncontrol.html#introduction_attribute-based-access-control_compare-rbac).\n\n**Related terms**\n\n  * [Global condition keys](./reference_policies_condition-keys.html)\n\n  * [Comparing ABAC to RBAC](./introduction_attribute-based-access-control.html#introduction_attribute-based-access-control_compare-rbac)\n\n  * [IAM JSON policy elements: Condition operators](./reference_policies_elements_condition_operators.html)\n\n  * [Condition element](./reference_policies_elements_condition.html)\n\n  * [Overview of JSON policies](./access_policies.html#access_policies-json)"
